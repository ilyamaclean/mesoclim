\title{Downscale shortwave radiation}
\usage{
swdownscale(
  swrad,
  tme,
  dtmf,
  dtmc,
  patchsim = FALSE,
  nsim = dim(swrad)[3],
  terrainshade = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{swrad}{an array of shortwave radiation (W/m^2).}

\item{tme}{POSIXlt object of times corresponding to radiation values in \code{swrad}.}

\item{dtmf}{a fine-resolution SpatRast of elevations. Temperatures down-scaled
to resolution of \code{dtmf}.}

\item{dtmc}{SpatRast of elevations matching the resolution, extend and coordinate
reference system of of \code{swrad}.}

\item{patchsim}{optional logical indicating whether to simulate cloud cover
patchiness during downscaling. More realistically captures variation, but slower.}

\item{nsim}{optionally the number of independent cloud cover patchiness simulations to perform. Outputs
are temporally interpolated (see details).}

\item{terrainshade}{optional logical indicating whether to adjust incoming radiation
for terrain shading. If TRUE, total downward shortwave radiation is partioned into its
direct and diffuse components, the latter adjusted by sky view and the former set
to zero if the sun is below the horizon, which is computed explicitly.}
}
\value{
if \code{terrainshade = FALSE} a multi-layer SpatRast of total shortwave radiation
(W/m^2) matching the resolution of dtmf. If if \code{terrainshade = TRUE} a list of wrapped multi-layer
SpatRasts of (1) total direct and difuse shortwave radiation (W/m^2) and (2) diffuse-only radiation  (W/m^2).

\description{
Downscales an array of shortwave radiation data with option to
simulate cloud patchiness and calculate diffuse radiation
}
\details{
radiation is downscaled by computing average fraction of clear-sky radiation
and then adjusting this variable to account for elevation using an emprical
adjustment calibrated against 0.05 degree data for the UK. If
\code{patchsim} is set to TRUE cloud cover patchiness is simulated the gstats package.
The parameter \code{nsim} determines the number of independent simulations and hence
the time intervals at which these simulations are performed. Simulated anomalies
due to local cloud patchiness are then interpolated temporally between these
periods. This ensures that, over shorter increments of say and hour, the location
clouds within each hour retain a degree of inter-dependence more realistically
simulating the trajectory of cloud as they move across the landscape.
