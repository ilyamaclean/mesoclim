\usage{
create_overlapping_tiles(template.r, overlap = 1000, sz = 10000)
}
\arguments{
\item{template.r}{= 1km land mask spatraster to inform whether land present}

\item{overlap}{= overlap in metres of each tile (x & y)}

\item{sz}{= base size of tiles in metres - some output tiles may be smaller}
}
\value{
named list where "tile_extents" holds the terra extent of each tile and
"tile_land" is BOOLEAN of whether land cells within tile (based on template.r).
Returned list ordered by cols.
